In this assignment I was tasked to analyse stock market data with given data (provided by edX Boot Camps LLC) for the years, 2018, 2019 and 2020. I used Visual Basic Application (VBA) in Microsoft Excel to develop the code for my analysis.  From the given data, my VBA script mainly calculates and projects the following information once the code is executed in the spreadsheet: 

(1)change in stock price, 
(2)percent change in stock price and,
(3)total volume of stock for each ticker (the company) at the end of each year. 

In addition, the script has the added formatting functionality to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red for calculations (1) and (2) listed above. The VBA script further calculates and projects output for the greatest Increase/Decrease in percent change in price as well the greatest total value of stock for each ticker at the end of the year.

In this repository, I have uploaded the VBA script file (the .bas file) as well as screenshots of the results I achieved for the 3 different years for atleast the first 27 rows of data. The .bas file can be imported in the raw data spreadsheet to excute the code.
